# Schumann Resonance Generator 🌍⚡  

This project was created with the idea of building **a simple yet interesting electronic device** capable of locally generating the most well-known **Schumann Resonance** frequencies, using the **Arduino** platform and easily available components.

> ⚠️ **Important note**  
> This project **is not a medical device** and makes no scientific claims. It is intended solely as an **electronic and educational experiment**.

## 📡 What Is the Schumann Resonance

The Schumann Resonance is a natural phenomenon discovered in the 1950s by physicist **Winfried Otto Schumann**.  
The Earth and the ionosphere behave like a kind of **natural cavity** in which certain electromagnetic frequencies can stabilize.

The most famous one is:
- **7.83 Hz** → fundamental frequency

Among the most well-known harmonics:
- **14.1 Hz**

These frequencies belong to the **ELF (Extremely Low Frequency)** category.

## 🤔 Why Does This Project Interest So Many People?

Online there are countless discussions, videos, and forums that attribute various **possible subjective effects** to the Schumann Resonance, often based on personal experiences.

The most common ones include:
- relaxation,
- improved sleep,
- stress reduction,
- increased concentration,
- a general sense of well-being.

👉 **Important:**  
These effects **are not scientifically proven**. However, curiosity and interest in these topics pushed me to experiment firsthand.

This project was born with exactly this mindset:  
**curiosity, DIY spirit, and conscious experimentation**.
